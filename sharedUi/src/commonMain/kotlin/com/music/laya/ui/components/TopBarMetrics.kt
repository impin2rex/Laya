 * inset is a property of the device and of the window, not of the app. A phone
 * with a cutout, one without, and a freeform window with no status bar at all
 * are all different numbers, and a fixed guess is wrong on all but one of them:
 * too tight and content is clipped under the bar, too loose and every page
 * opens on a band of empty space.
